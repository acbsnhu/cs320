How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by running designed tests on
  it. This can be a daunting task that I have first learned about while being a
  student in this class. I can take what the user gives me as thier requirments
  and desgin my testing around what they are looking for. These tests will show 
  a percentage of coverage that they cover over the sections of codde they are 
  testing. This allows me to see if my code is functioning correctly and if sections
  of code are truly needed. The test results will also tell me if the expected reslult
  of a test is true meaning I will see if the code doesnt behave correctly. This
  will allow me to see if the error is in the testing approach or if I need to adjust 
  the code.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I first take everything the user says or writes to me and I break it down into
  sections. Then I orgragise those sections in a logically way that the program 
  would flow or function. This allows me to have a map of how to proceed and gives me
  an idea of what to expect when it comes to what the user is looking for. For
  example the user gave us a requirment that the entry fields couldnt be left blank.
  I was able to interpet this through the notes provided and incorporate into my program.
  Then I was able to write a Junit test that ran the code leaving fields blank with the 
  expected outcome being an illegal entry and he test passed. Meaning that I successfully
  incorprated the users requirment and that the code would not allow entrys to remain blank.

How do I approach designing software?
  My approach to desgining software is very similar to how I interpret user needs. I 
  first take all notes and/or transcripts from meetings or emails from the users. Then 
  I organise them into parts and sections so that I have a logical flow of requirments
  and how they should run together. I then while writing the code will reference this
  map/checklist making sure that I am following the users desgin as best as I can. Then
  when I am done I follow through with testing the software and making sure all user needs
  or requirments are met.
